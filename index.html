    <h2>Origami is can be way more interesting than you imagined! 
        here are some interesting facts about origami</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you 
            will be granted a wish. Feeling lucky?</li>
        <li>Initially, the art of paper folding was restricted only to ceremonial
             occasions because paper was scarce and expensive.</li>
        <li>In Japan, the biggest origami of all time is a bird, it's 86 meters
             tall and was made by 800 people.</li>
        <li>In feudal Japan, samurai prepared themselves for battle with training
             in martial arts and...by making origami. The technique helped them reach
              an optimal and relaxed state of concentration, and companions used to gift
               each other cranes, symbols of honor and loyalty, a tradition that’s
                maintained even today among the Japanese.</li>
